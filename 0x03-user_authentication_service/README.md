- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7)
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
- Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5)
- You should use SQLAlchemy 1.3.x
- All your files must be executable
- All your functions should be type annotated
- The flask app should only interact with Auth and never with DB directly.
- Only public methods of Auth and DB should be used outside these classes
